# Website
My first approach to build a website only by using HTML and CSS . This website is made for displaying my drawings.

## Resources
I have watched some youtube videos and attended a workshop on front end development for beginners

### Learning
This was a great experience for me as it is my first project in front end development.

This is my website [ARTCHEF](https://praveen007-k.github.io/artchef.github.io/).
